## Setup: Adding Workflows to `.replit`

Add these to your `.replit` file to create separate workflow panels:

```ini
[Start application]
run = "npm run dev"

[backend-console]
run = "tsx server/console/index.ts"

[db-monitor]
run = "tsx server/console/database-monitor.ts"

[auth-monitor]
run = "tsx server/console/auth-monitor.ts"

[performance-monitor]
run = "tsx server/console/performance-monitor.ts"

[log-export]
run = "tsx server/console/log-export.ts"
```

Each workflow runs independently and can be started/stopped separately.

## Tips

1. **Run Multiple Workflows**: All workflows can run simultaneously
2. **Shared Logs**: All workflows read from the same in-memory log store
3. **No Authentication**: Console workflows don't require auth
4. **Real-time Updates**: Monitoring workflows refresh every 5 seconds
5. **Exit Safely**: Press Ctrl+C to exit any monitoring workflow
